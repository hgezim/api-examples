Ziplist Spice API Code Examples and Software Shims

This repository contains software examples, and sample shims for working with the 
ZipList, Inc.  SPICE APIs.  If you are a ZipList partner, or potential partner
then feel free to have a look around. If you are just curious, feel free to look 
around.

Please take a moment to read the license. It is paraphrased here in plain english:

This is all sample code.  There is no warranty.  There are no claims of suitability 
for use in your development environment. These examples are meant for demonstration
purposes only, and to serve to help springboard your own development, and API
integration efforts. If you cut and paste into your application, and there is a bug
we will not be held liable.  You can not use any of this against our APIs until you
have a license agreement with ZipList, and ZipList has issued you a partner key.
Without partner credentials none of it will work anyway.  By making this code public
we are neither granting nor implying a license to use ZipList, Inc.  APIs.
